through the cool, humid wood with water like air and 
air like water and you not there to bear witness

eyes' periphery, like glaucoma and god and green 
like there is no tomorrow­­or at least there might 
not be­­and this erratic glow is all there is or ever 
was, save you, of course, forever and ever, amen

imagine the tragedy of the banjo strummed and 
frailed like a locomotive, from all directions, at 
all hours, and for all definitions of 'good,' to ten 
thousand tunes and each giving way to the next 
as one barefoot to another pass along the path 
home to a tent still wet with the presence of you

i don't miss you; it's just
i wish you could know
the sawing serenades of the cicada trapped between the rainflap and the roof
the scratchy sound of soul in bowed horse hair rubbed over ribbed steel
the wet squelch of last nights rain bubbled up between bare toes like mud and molasses
the sound of a gospel chorus swelling as the thunder approaches and the battle to be heard against god comes in a dead tie
or even just the memory of every piece of you on every breath

i think about deserve

sometimes when you're loud
i feel like all the unused rooms
of the swollen houses in arlington
will finally be filled with the right stuff
enclosures mortally pierced
denials gusted from their black undusted 
sticking places & jellyfish housewomen
will drop their flummery & not scream
will run full speed towards walls
will burn footlockers of their sinful knickknackery 
will begin latching themselves to the readyline 
of peripatetic ritual

sometimes when you're loud 
spheres of knowing collapse into 
one plane of knowing & all
the unordained particles & molecular s
ubstructures & trillions upon
trillions of random disconnected constructs 
start to simmer the fuck down
like the porcelain fat that eventually gathers 
on the bottoms of prepared meats
until samesies

sometimes when you're loud
all those colliding caravans of
smashing infinities beyond human count
create a place context time reality way on a plane 
when randomness stops
when deserve begins
when symbols die & fences uproot
when faces are in charge again
when there is no trajedy
when the shifting meanings & thickets of experience 
seize me bit upon bit

sometimes when you're loud
the world just slips screaming down a muddy crevasse & 
i look around for the commotion but
the only thing i can see is the quiet you
the sounds of your back freckles &
the brush of your hairbun
the taste of your lips & mouth

<h2><a href="#">on a certain timescale</a></h2>
<div class="pome">
on a cosmic timescale
you are less than a blink
you are approximating 
nothing, an almost infinite 
number of zeroes following 
the decimal point like
space rocks circling
dust and debris, the detritus 
of genesis like, "let there be..."

still,
on a cardiovascular timescale 
you are the million heartbeats 
an organism gets before it 
dies, tissues left to fungal 
decay, eyes eaten from
the sockets by still­-hungry 
maggots and ok, yes,
I know I am prone to fits
of exaggeration but you are 
brand new, every idea I had 
I've tossed aside and now 
there is only the real

exempli gratia:
I used to think, I should assume 
some level of asynchronous
in love but when you spoke
the unspoken rule about
freedom and me, I just about
died right there, sitting silent
in the passenger seat
our mantra­mission starting
sprout was "to help people
define their own standards
of happiness and pursue them 
unfettered" I almost got it
tattooed on my body until
I decided never to put a word
on my skin, since language is 
mediated meaning, a representation 
of the real, but not the real itself

id est:
I used to think, I can only know 
one thing in relation to another 
but no thing truly on its own 
some metaphysical manifestation 
of neuroplasticity, like we are all
just walking on the eraser
of a giant's scribbling pencil 
wind a frustrated sigh, but you 
are a meteor come down
in the middle of my meadow 
as if all ignorance
really does toboggan
into know

confer:
I used to think, I fall in love 
slowly, taking my time 
savoring each piece, like 
Mary Maclane proclaiming 
"go hang yourself, you
who have never been 
comfortably seated and 
eating an olive" but with you 
I knew in an instant, like 
ramen or coffee's crystalline 
lattice or immediate and 
complete death by dfw's 
absolute ultimate and 
complete video rental

so,
on a more correct timescale 
there is just now and no 
cross­referencing, only a point, 
compressed from the line, 
moving through space and time 
which I can only hope will pass 
through bicycles beds train­ 
pressed pennies ghettoized 
records horror movies in the 
rain on Sunday afternoons 
cassavetes lathe­cuts western 
mass catholic mass rye berries 
early morning face flush floss 
sharing toothbrushes walking 
barefoot up rocky riverbeds 
moving and packing all eggs 
banjo brine north carolina 
moms dads melting smiles and 
shoulder shudders and at least 
a million more goodbyes
from which each time
you leave me throbbing

you're an idiot

A just today said
after smart warnings of carrying 
baggage & keeping close watches 
on things & making sure alone
time was happening & masking sadness 
behind telling the right truth
A just today said
she knew this was coming
      because of how we are 
      around one another

A just today said
      i really think the two of you
      without question
      were meant to be together

<div class="pome">
midnight stroke & I am key stroke sending priceless poems through the star­filled sky.

three & I curl fetal and shivering into sleeping bag pod with cheek to chuckanucka and eyes to screen, sent to sleep by a brief burst of late­night love.

six & banjos raise the sun like roosters with a swelling sound throbbing like three years' yearning bottled again so three days seems like nothing or everything or maybe just three days.

nine & a man from Florida pours me coffee, which you never drink, god bless your every bit, but for me is ritual, hedonism, dunkins, warmth.

twelve & I fall into sleep dep­induced hysteria and spite with Peter, laughing til tears about the vapid souls who play so many meaningless notes with Buchak saying, "Without a personal quest, you learn the skills without the why," and I think, "KP!"

three & Beadle leads me through the same woods I've come to know alone each morning and finally to a new frigid pool whose submersion pulls the breath from the lungs like death or a dead punch or maybe just a cold, cold wind, him placing me just so beneath the falls to feel the look­no­hands­just­water massage.

six & on the elated hike back this same boy from Birmingham with the whooping holler, dancing legs, fiddle fingers, curly­early­greying beard says, "You know, I'm trying to let go of expectations which seem to be, like, the source of all suffering," and I think again, "KPR!"

nine & square dancing and bodies and hands and spinning, stopping, stomping, jumping, smiling, twirling and face flush, sweat, fiddles and loud calls, eye contact of every variety, an ecstatic, collective body high, sure, but I remember the high of just laying eyes so let's get real, P.

midnight again & our harmonies legit hit heaven, touching the stars in ways that make the reserved blush and the alive come, touched by the vibrations of voices originating at the ridgeline from mouths sharing food and whiskey and ancient words of love, death, murder, chickens, trains, god, but actually, somehow, each one turns out to be about you.

as i rest on your pillow
having just awoken from a most 
amazing dream mare
about being pranked by you 
four minutes that felt like
four hours i cannot shake

like i cannot shake 
when i first walked up 
to the pond when 
you stood backlit & 
came in close
after a hug i

touched your back
like a coda
& you gave a rapid
glance like a microshudder 
of expectation or

seth
the first person to hire me in boston
who refused to read ezra pound because anti­semite
who gave up a law practice to start a jazz record store in 1978 
whose nosehairs could catch dismember & consume flies 
who at the first classical concert of his life
following decade upon decade of jazz shows
stood & jumped & applauded & yelped after being
particularly impressed with a mid­piece massed crescendo
his thirty year girlfriend librarian trying to stop him
the rest of the hall perfunctorily silent
audience & even performers
shaking their heads
this is how i love you

i needed to learn how to be happy
     <i>there was a child went forth every day</i>
how to jump with arms
how to be eyes alive
how to read with lips & voice that it was a choice
one after another after another

danny's attempt
started while confused in love at a party & how couldn't he be behind 
twenty beers a dozen mixed shots two michelles
he punched me punched brick walls & when we shoehorned him
into a backseat punched black vinyl & punched our heads & kicked 
windows & screamed the unspeakable until
on arrival he passed out & we absconded
bj the fourteen year old man cried like a fourteen year old
locked out on a deck we heard the car door slam
down & around we ran through branches gravel doors rooms up stairs 
tackling him shotgun in mouth shells falling barrels silent silent
we hugged our hysterical brother tightly for hours
through the night
this is how i love you

i needed to learn long ago how to bike
     <i>shimmy shimmy coco pop shimmy shimmy ra</i>
but now it has been made new again riding down steep hills
riding in midnight city potholes
riding on thunderdown faded whites that it was a choice
one after another after another

hawaii 1994
want to say february junior year
day ten or eleven booked a helicopter so we could
vibrate loudly over volcanoes
vibrate loudly like magnum p.i.
vibrate loudly over igneous boulders that transformed toddler drew into hercules 
when we landed for fuel on some other island &
the second family's hidden infant pulled from under mother's shirt
suckling to help calm the violent vibrations
had suffocated to absolute still death blue & purple & no pink
my stepmom performed cardiopulmonary code sande intaking & spitting out 
breastmilk like gray thrush pus after each pump she
would not yield
this is how i love you

i needed to learn long ago how to love
     <i>if tomorrow wasn't such a long time i would lie in my bed once again</i>
pining for A veiga whose father was a mailman pining for some hairful beat beauty
pining for one who would just know & accept
that it was a choice
one after another after another

clown christ
memory of some woodenbuilding religious camp in the evening 
of which my dad has no recollection but stands one of my earliest 
projected by camera onto a white bedsheet in front
of fifteen or thirty people in what maybe
was a short budget regional xian film definitely black & white 
about a pointy white hatted & baggy white costumed
clown in clown nose that was a clear metaphor for christ
some kind of crying near a large nail cross
some kind of holy unchaplin sad christian conflation magic silent 
but i remember the flitting tick ticking cinema & flowing sheet 
folding chair audience the shimmering lights & like a
higher & lower fellini street march of no sound &
dancing flickering filaments
this is how i love you

i needed to learn you could exist three years ago
     <i>rolling apples fall like meteors of light</i>
almost to the day but i am so so keen so dying
to see you
to see you in so many new lights situations shades scenarios responses 
to see what else your faces do
to see you
to see you
to see you know how i love you
that it was a choice
one after another after another

<h2><a href="#">actually, eight know</a></h2>
<div class="pome">
before leaving
for WV I told Kate, who is a deep­-feeler like me and not at all like me, about you,
the ethereal other because my world has not had the pleasure of being
colonized by your you, meaning everyone is deeply deprived but also
that there will likely be no heart­-break noodle­-shares and the meetings will be mostly 
uncomplicated expansions of loved one's worlds to make space for
the exaltation I have kept close­-closeted and under­-wraps for so long

I told her how I'd never first­-kissed someone I was already busting­-my-­gut
in love with and about jetty­-swagger vulnerability­-boy on eastie piers, to which her eyes 
widened and she said the exact phrase you'd used the day before, that
those with whom she 'saw the world with the same eyes' were the most
profound humans in her fold but that they always unfolded because they saw­-same together but 
also wept­-yelled-­raged-­mistrusted-­hurt­-same and then eventually everything unraveled

in Detroit
Maggie and I were in bed together the moment I received a price­-pome and 
buried my head in my pillow like an ostrich in the sand and she also isn't 
dumb so she heard the whole thing and is in love with the love
I have for you or
whatever it is she took from the tongues I spoke in my elated state

days before
when I told him, Alec, like a good friend and himself, asked what I loved about you and
after listening said, 'wow, shaunalynn, that sounds seriously special' and also, maybe­-joking, 'not to be a downer,
but you told me you wanted to stay single for a while after Kevin'

while you
were in Paris, Rosalie and I ate mussels and drank wheat beers and talked about 
Kevin­-and-­Edison and change, childhoods, loyalty, and obligation
I told her about the way people were everything or nothing to me, how
I was all­-in or all­-out and wasn't in the habit of hiding it how
I once told Aaron that if he ever got any capital­-i ideas he had to fucking call me,
wake me from a dead sleep, in the middle of the night, get me fired, anything, I'd come
if he just said the word and the word became a no­-reason-­call so when
he'd call just to say, 'hey!' I'd jump­-run-­cab-­t-­fucking­-freakbeam myself to his body and sometimes 
he really was just saying hey and we'd look at eachother dumb and dry

I didn't tell her how we both knew it couldn't work if the moment really came and how I wonder 
still if his last email was a no­reason­call I never returned, reading,
'Unfortunately the corn muffin situation in this city is pretty dreadful. Txt me when you get here?'

instead I went to the bathroom and came out and said, 'look­-bitch,' and under 
strictest confidence told her I was losing myself to the tide of your existence 
and it was probably actually­-nothing but it wasn't nothing­-to-­me
which of course she already knew and I told her how the last person
who asked me to take a silence had died first 
and she said, 'just­-wait'

before Paris,
I tentatively told my mom who gave me the three golden rules I told you 
in a lookout tower: leave the wife­-house, love the kids, trust the magic

pomes at you like punches and spittle
or kisses and headbutts and teaspoons 
like i wasn't sure it was actually real and 
in your absence might discover all feeling 
evaporated into nothingness and i was
a walker wheezing sad sounds through 
rotten teeth with no memory of the life
i once lived with arms and lips intact

i wrote this line before you even left
like i could get a head start on coming 
back like there aren't laws governing

to make feet, like babies pitter pattering, like Dali
up the walls and windows against rhyme, reason, gravity, time.

at forty thousand feet, however and needless to say, 
it's about more than just money, more than the climate 
deniers are willing to not not say, it's a simple matter 
of life and death, where the alien ray shining through 
those two glass sheets, the air trapped between 
in a vacuum like space where no one can hear you 
scream and even if they did, there were nine. minutes. 
lost. between those panes, the stakes are higher, the 
fall longer, the temperature lower, the what ifs not so 
easily remedied by butt snuggles under blankets because 
the comforters of the sky are cloud coffins, feather dusters 
clearing out every cobweb and corner if I lost you.

The horizontal rain, bang bang, 
and the buildings vertical, pow,
and the elderly men, then, 
Southeast Asian beside motorcycles 
and smoking cigarettes, leaned against 
leather banana seats with mirrors 
tilted and smoky breaths pooling in the 
still heat. The dense clouds have 
mass, their edges distinct, blown 
slow against wind and breath both 
moving more quickly, dragging their 
feet, heels heavy, molecules slow
mixing at the edges, blurring 
where the tar and taint meet, 
where the rubber meets the road, 
where you can't have one 
without the other.

The long necked cranes' metal teeth break ground like tarama with truffle,
asphalt soft and shapely like the cityscape was meant to be molded
by machines, hard as steel, sheared like glass or granite, micah or quartz, 
rosy behind the early morning haze, drifting south from Malaysia with love.

The chronic grinding sounds of progress move like clouds of dust
more or less here or there but present like a Zen master making manifest
the unity of all things, the duality of subject and object, the non-existent I.

The streams of cars like time-lapsed head lamps with wide right hands,
the multi-lane streets stretched arm upon arm to the concrete other side,
where the light blinks, where the fences break, where the sidewalks end,
where the pedestrian overpasses bloom and the underpasses hide below
nondescript signs hawking walking paths with felony record alternatives.

The city is all above and equally below, multi-tiered, high-rise, underground,
but mostly in malls, with shivering back drafts and patient, breathy steps.
The escalators move faster and stay flatter longer. The overcast skies squint
eyelids as if mirages lie in wait, making shady moments tense and furrowed 
like the asymmetrical crevice of my true love's brow, one deep dent like 
a magical scar, one line carved out whether angry, skeptical, or proud.

In a country whose national bird is a metal giraffe, a construction crane,
my heart's head, like an ostrich, snuggles into the sandy earth until the sun 
rises, the world spins, the date line dances backward underfoot, until my 
baby's babies run circles round the bed we sleep circles round all night long, 
all night long, until the rising and setting of the sun return to the rote 
rhythm of our rotating sphere, with the ebbing tides and circadian sundials, 
and the cells screaming out to sleep all night long, all night long, all night
